In this repository, we analyze, in R, offensive player data in the NFL. Below is a brief description of each file:

- **summary_stats.R**  
  Provides initial data visualizations and summary statistics for 2022 weekly data.

- **summary_stats.log**  
  Contains the console output from running **summary_stats.R**.

- **attempt1.R**  
  An initial script experimenting with linear regressions and k-means clustering. It does not predict but carries over methods from earlier assignments.

- **prediction.R**  
  A first attempt at predictive modeling using linear regression, LASSO, Ridge, random forest, and XGBoost. Results are logged in **output.log**.

- **prediction2.R**  
  Extends the predictive approach with additional features and computes feature importance. Results are logged in **output2.log**.

- **output.log**  
  Contains the console output from running **prediction.R**.

- **output2.log**  
  Contains the console output from running **prediction2.R**.

- **Rplots.pdf**  
  Displays initial data visualizations, which are not highly informative.
